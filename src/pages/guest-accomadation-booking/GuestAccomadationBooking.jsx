              IIT Bombay has witnessed a large increase in the intake of students in this academic year, which resulted in a gradual decrease in the guest rooms and vacant rooms available in the hostels. Since we have very few Guest Room / Vacant Rooms available in the Hostels, The Institute has taken a call to shut down the Guest Booking System. This was decided in order to keep guest rooms available for Institute Guests, Students Parents, Students Spouse or Interview Applicants.
            </p>

            <h6 className='mx-4 px-4'>These are the following rules for Guest Room Bookings:</h6>
            <ul className='mx-4 px-4'>
                <li className='mx-4 px-4'>Guest Rooms can be booked only for parents.</li>
                <li className='mx-4 px-4'>Siblings (Brothers / Sisters) accompanying parents will be allowed for Guest booking.</li>
                <li className='mx-4 px-4'>Guest Room can be booked for spouse (with valid marriage certificate)</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mx-4 my-3 px-4">
              Students have to submit an offline application to Associate Dean Student Affairs attaching all necessary documents. Students have to submit the application at least 1 week prior the date of booking to avoid last minute constraints. Guest room booking is allowed only 20 days proir the date of booking.
